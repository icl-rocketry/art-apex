## What's going on here?

This folder contains a bunch of .ino files designed to benchmark a board, to see how fast it is / how it performs in different conditions.

## How to use

Move the benchmark you want into `/software/apex` and compile and upload the code to the board.
Then you can use the serial monitor to see how fast it is.
