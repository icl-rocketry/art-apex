Be able to program sending and receiving packets
Be able to test the program in conditions - transmission failure rate + rocket position + ground station position + devices each with ranges

They should need to write code for the rocket and receivers, treating the ground station as a receiver
They shouldn't need to worry about the underlying lora transmission, that'll come later
The lora transmission class should have the same interface between simulation and not
The simulation will load up all the devices, rocket and receivers and the lora classes
Ignores movement, only cares about static position

Simulation tick: 
1. The rocket broadcasts its message, into a message queue in the simulator
2. While loop through all devices, until none of them have anything to broadcast

Broadcasts will fail if 2 happen at the same time and can hit the same devices.
Each broadcast takes some transmission time t, proportional to the distance between the sender and receiver (in this case, exactly equal) - Update 29/11/22 Nope that's dumb each message will take 1 tick, which corresponds to 1 second, the underlying lora implementation must guarantee this though
